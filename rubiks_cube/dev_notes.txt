Defor -> Default orientation

0. States
	- Selected layer (User changeable) : position-index of center-voxel (see layer semantics)
	- Layer snapped : bool
	
1. Voxel
	- Color for each vertex-index : set in solved defor space
	- Transform in defor space
	- Store voxels in a constant array (vox-array)
	
2. Layer semantics 
	- Position index that is constant in defor-space
	- A layer is simply a fixed set of position indices
	- Map position-indices to voxel-indices in vox-array
	- A layer can be specified solely by position-index of center-voxel

3. Cube-movement semantics
	- Rotating : select position-indices of selected layer and change transform of all corresponding voxels within defor-space itself. Set snapped to false
	- Snapping : select position-indices of selected layer and change corresponding vox-array-index to snap. Set snapped to true
	- Rotating whole cube : have a global rotation transform, applied to all voxel transforms (which are in defor space) before rendering
	
4. User utility
	- Can take a ray and tell which position-index it intersects with (or if it doesn't)
		- Iterate through all position-indices, transform corresponding voxel-transforms (which are in defor-space) to world-space and test ray-intersection
	- Can take a position-index and return a list of layers (position-index of center-voxel) it is contained in, and corresponding axes (see user logic)
	- Can take position-index of center-voxel and apply given rotation
	
5. User logic
	- Transform mouse-movement from view-space to defor-space
	- If snapped : 
		- Cast mouse-movement along the axes retrieved, and store position-index of center-voxel with maximum projection along corresponding axis
		- Set selected layer to above retrieved position-index of center-voxel
		- Store corresponding axis
		- Rotate
	- If unsnapped :
		- Cast mouse-movement along stored axis
		- Rotate
	- If mouse released, snap layer
